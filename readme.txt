This is the readme file for the first practical session in the course "Reinforcement Learning & Decision-Making: Computational & Neural Mechanisms".

To get started
- go to colab (https://colab.research.google.com/)
- in the pop-up window go to the "Github" tab
- paste the link to the *students.ipynb file (https://github.com/fwurm/RLDM/blob/master/RLDM_Practical_student_2023.ipynb) and press search

This should open the jupyter notebook. 

You can now start to explore the wonderful world of reinforcement learning :)

Please let me know if there are any issues or problems with the script.
